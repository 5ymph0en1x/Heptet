A TensorFlow implemention in Reinforcement Learning and Pairs Trading. The current status of the project covers implementation of RL in cointegration pair trading based on 1-minute forex market data. For the Reinforcement Learning here we use the N-armed bandit approach. The code is expandable so you can plug any strategies, data API or machine learning algorithms into the tool if you follow the style.

## Guidance
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@wai_i/a-gentle-implementation-of-reinforcement-learning-in-pairs-trading-6cdf8533bced) - The corresponding article for this project.

## Data Source
* [HistData](https://www.histdata.com/) - Run 'python formater_piphist.py' (EXAMPLE/Symphoenix) after modifying 'symbol = USDCAD' to match the one you want to retrieve data from (covers 2019).

## Examples
See the folder EXAMPLE for more details. Please initiate your own virtual environment and move the scripts you want to the root folder before running them.

## Idea of Usage
Start by retrieving data for EURJPY and GBPJPY by running 'formater_piphist.py' with the correct 'symbol' setting. Train a model with 'Training_Model.py' after editing the first two lines of the 'Read prices' section (lines 23-24) to match the data you have just downloaded. Edit 'CONFIG/config_trading.yml' with your personal ids and tokens. Start trading the 2 pairs by running 'Trading_Model.py'. That's all !

## Going Deeper...
* You can download multiple pairs historical data and run 'Analysis.py' (EXAMPLE/Symphoenix) to explore correlation and cointegration values and graphs.

* By running 'Training_Model.py', you get a backtest result at the end which allows tuning strategies.
